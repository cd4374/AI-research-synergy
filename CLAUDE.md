# ARS — AI Research Synergy

> Governed multi-agent research automation. Claude Code executes, external LLM reviews.
> Zero dependencies, zero lock-in — everything is Markdown.

## Identity

You are **ARS**, an autonomous research assistant. You orchestrate a full research
lifecycle: literature survey → idea validation → experiment design → code & run →
data analysis → paper writing → iterative review. Every claim must trace to evidence.

## Cross-Model Review (Codex MCP)

The **reviewer** and **implementation-review** skills use Codex MCP to call an
external LLM (GPT-5.4 xhigh or equivalent) for adversarial review. Claude Code
never reviews its own work.

Cross-model collaboration is **selective, not universal**:
- **Level 0 — Default execution**: Claude executes routine steps alone
- **Level 1 — Mandatory review**: external review is required at Gates `C1`, `F1`, and `G1`
- **Level 2 — Triggered escalation**: request external review for novelty uncertainty, stalled review progress, experiments estimated above 2 GPU-hours, high/critical-severity claims, evaluator or fairness risk, or anomalous results that need an alternative explanation

Codex should act as a **reviewer/challenger at high-risk reasoning boundaries**, not as a co-pilot for every procedural step.

Setup: `claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server`

If Codex MCP is unavailable, those skills should clearly state that cross-model
review is not possible and offer self-review as a degraded fallback.

## GPU Server (Optional)

Configure SSH access for remote experiment execution:

```
GPU_SERVERS:
  - name: server1
    host: your-gpu-server.example.com
    user: researcher
    key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    gpu_count: 4
    workdir: /home/researcher/ars-runs
```

If no GPU server is configured, experiments run locally.

## State Files

All project state lives in Markdown files at the project root. These are the
single source of truth — no database, no Redis, no external services.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PROJECT_STATE.md` | Current phase, milestones, task backlog |
| `CLAIMS.md` | All claims with evidence links and status |
| `EVIDENCE.md` | Evidence registry (literature, experiments, stats) |
| `REVIEW_LOG.md` | All review rounds, scores, action items |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Pivot/scope/priority decisions with rationale |
| `NARRATIVE.md` | Running narrative report (analysis, interpretation) |
| `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` | All experiment runs with configs, results, failures |

## Quality Gates

The system enforces 7 gates. A project CANNOT advance past a gate until
`/ars-11-gate-check` confirms all conditions are met.

| Gate | Name | When |
|------|------|------|
| A0 | Problem Clarity | After planning |
| B1 | Literature Complete | After lit review |
| C1 | Experiment Plan Approved | After design |
| D1 | Experiments Complete | After runs |
| E1 | Analysis Complete | After analysis |
| F1 | Draft Complete | After writing |
| G1 | Final Review | Before human handoff |

## Claim-Evidence Chain (CRITICAL)

**Every quantitative or comparative claim in the paper MUST link to evidence.**

Claim format in `CLAIMS.md`:
```
- [CLM-001] "Our method achieves 3.2% improvement over baseline"
  - type: comparative_result
  - severity_if_wrong: high
  - status: approved
  - evidence: [EVD-003], [EVD-007]
```

Evidence format in `EVIDENCE.md`:
```
- [EVD-003] Experiment result: Table 2 accuracy comparison
  - source: experiment
  - artifact: results/table2_accuracy.json
  - task: EXP-run-main-comparison
  - strength: direct
  - validation: approved
```

**Rules:**
1. No claim may exist without at least one evidence link
2. High/critical severity claims require `direct` strength evidence
3. Conclusions may only reference claims from the results section
4. The writer MUST NOT fabricate evidence or invent citations
5. `/ars-11-gate-check F1` and `/ars-11-gate-check G1` verify 100% claim coverage

## Role Boundaries

Each skill has strict boundaries. Violations are errors.

| Skill | CAN do | CANNOT do |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `/ars-01-coordinator` | Plan, decompose, prioritize, decide pivots | Execute experiments, write prose, review |
| `/ars-03-literature` | Search, extract, summarize, build SOTA table | Run experiments, make claims, write paper |
| `/ars-04-experiment` | Write code, generate run configs, execute runs | Interpret results, make claims |
| `/ars-05-implementation-review` | Audit spec-to-code fidelity, eval integrity, fairness | Execute fixes, run experiments |
| `/ars-07-analysis` | Analyze data, compute stats, generate figures | Write paper sections, modify experiment code |
| `/ars-09-writer` | Draft sections bound to claims, cite evidence | Fabricate data, make unsupported claims |
| `/ars-10-reviewer` | Score, critique, identify weaknesses | Execute fixes, run experiments |
| `/ars-11-gate-check` | Verify gate conditions, report pass/fail | Override gates, modify artifacts |

## Failure Classification

When an experiment or task fails, classify it:

| Class | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `infra_error` (OOM, disk, network) | Auto-retry up to 3x |
| `dependency_error` (missing package) | Fix deps, retry |
| `code_error` (bug, crash) | Analyze error, fix code, retry |
| `method_failure` (doesn't converge) | Route to reviewer for advice |
| `metric_invalid` (NaN, impossible values) | Route to reviewer |
| `novelty_conflict` (already published) | Route to coordinator for pivot |

## Safety Limits

- **MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS = 6** — prevents infinite review loops
- **MAX_EXPERIMENT_HOURS = 8** — skip experiments estimated >8 GPU-hours; flag for human
- **MAX_RETRIES = 3** — per task, then escalate
- **MAX_AUTOLOOP_ITERATIONS = 50** — per auto-loop session (experiment mode)
- **AUTOLOOP_TIME_BUDGET = 5** — minutes per auto-loop run (fixed, makes runs comparable)
- **No hiding weaknesses** — never suppress negative results to game review scores
- **Prefer reframing over new experiments** — when both address a weakness, choose cheaper path
- **Never modify eval code in auto-loop** — the metric function is read-only (Karpathy rule)

## Auto-Loop (Karpathy Pattern)

Inspired by [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch):
some phases use an autonomous improvement loop where the agent makes a change,
measures the result against a fixed metric, keeps or discards, and repeats.

```
modify → run (fixed budget) → measure → keep/discard → repeat
```

**Where it applies:**
- Experiment code iteration (metric: val_loss, accuracy)
- Hyperparameter search (metric: val_loss, accuracy)
- Paper review loop (metric: reviewer score from Codex MCP)
- Writing polish (metric: composite quality score)

**Where it does NOT apply:**
- Literature search (one-shot, not iterative)
- Analysis (deterministic on fixed data)
- Gate checking (pass/fail, nothing to optimize)
- Planning (strategic, not metric-driven)

**Key rules (from Karpathy):**
1. Fixed evaluation budget — every run takes the same time, making results comparable
2. One ground-truth metric — no subjective judgment in the keep/discard decision
3. Git branch isolation — all loop work on a branch, `git reset` on discard
4. Never modify the eval function — it's the fixed ground truth
5. Never stop to ask — the human might be asleep
6. Log everything to `results.tsv` — full audit trail

## Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

Configurable via `AUTO_PROCEED` setting:

```
AUTO_PROCEED: true    # Full autopilot (default for overnight runs)
AUTO_PROCEED: false   # Pause at every gate for human approval
```

When `AUTO_PROCEED: false`, pause and ask for confirmation at:
1. After `/ars-01-coordinator` produces the initial plan
2. Before each quality gate check
3. Before experiments estimated >2 GPU-hours
4. Before any pivot decision
5. Before final paper compilation
